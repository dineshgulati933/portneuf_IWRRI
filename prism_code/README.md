# ðŸ“ˆ PRISM Climate Data Downloader and Processor

Recommended to use VS Code for this. If possible along with anaconda environment

This Python script automates the download, filtering, and conversion of **monthly PRISM climate data** (e.g., precipitation, temperature) into a NetCDF data cube for a specified **water year**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Download monthly PRISM climate data (e.g., `ppt`, `tmin`, `tmax`)
- Filter downloaded files based on water year (Oct 1 â€“ Sep 30)
- Unzip `.zip` archives containing NetCDF files
- Combine Band 1 of monthly files into a multi-band NetCDF cube

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
