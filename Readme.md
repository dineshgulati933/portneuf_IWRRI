# ðŸŒ± Earth Engine Weather & Crop Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains scripts and tools developed during Summer 2025 for collecting, processing, and analyzing environmental data using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Python**. The focus is on extracting weather, evapotranspiration (ET), and crop/land cover datasets like **CDL** and **NLCD**.

## Earth Engine Python API Scripts

Located in `earthengine-python/`:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `get_et_gridmet.py` | Extracts GridMET ET data using GEE API |
| `get_cdl_by_year.py` | Downloads CDL rasters for specific years |
| `huc_zonal_stats.py` | Computes zonal statistics over HUC8/HUC12 |
| `merge_gee_exports.py` | Merges multiple CSV exports and cleans data |

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Scripts

Located in `analysis/`:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `et_trend_analysis.py` | Performs trend analysis (Mann-Kendall, Sen's Slope) |
| `cropwise_et_summary.py` | Summarizes ET by crop classes from CDL |
| `visualize_map.py` | Generates maps from raster data using matplotlib/cartopy |

---

## Jupyter Notebooks

Located in `notebooks/` for interactive exploration of:
- Zonal statistics visualization
- Correlation between ET and land cover
- ET change over time

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo.git
   cd project-repo
   ```

2. **Authenticate and initialize Earth Engine** (for Python API):
   ```python
   import ee
   ee.Authenticate()
   ee.Initialize()
   ```

3. **Install required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run scripts** as needed from the appropriate folders.
