# ðŸŒ± Portneuf River Watershed â€“ Initial Hydrologic Analysis 

This repository contains scripts and tools developed for collecting, processing, and analyzing hydrological data using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Python**. The focus is on extracting weather (**gridMET**, **PRISM**),
 evapotranspiration (**gridMET**, **OpenET**), and crop/land cover datasets (**CDL** and **NLCD**).

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Scripts

Located in `analysis/`:

*This folder contains comprehensive analyses at the HUC12 level within the Portneuf watershed. It includes all relevant datasets, their preprocessing workflows, and detailed analytical scripts for trend detection, statistical summaries, and visualization.*

  <em>Map of HUC12 regions used for analysis</em>
</p>


| Folders | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cdl` | USDA CDL data merging, preprocessing and trend analysis (Mann-Kendall, Sen's Slope) along with graphics |
| `gridmet` | gridMET precip, temp, eto, and etr data , preprocessing, stats and trend analysis (Mann-Kendall, Sen's Slope) along with graphics |
| `IRR` | IrrMapper data merging and initial analysis along with graphics |
| `nlcd` | NLCD data merging and initial analysis along with graphics |
| `npp` | Landsat NPP data merging and initial analysis along with graphics |
| `openet` | OpenET data merging and initial analysis along with graphics. Also include dataset of each individual model |
| `portneuf_aoi` | Dissolved Portneuf shapefile |
| `portneuf_huc12` | Portneuf shapefile with HUC12 features |
| `utils` | Contains modular Python utility scripts offering reusable functions for statistical trend analysis (Sen's Slope, Mann-Kendall tests), data preprocessing, and automated generation of high-quality, publication-ready plots. These utilities streamline workflows and are leveraged across multiple notebooks for consistency and efficiency |
---

> **Note:**  
> If you are using the `trend_sen` module (which provides functions for calculating Sen's Slope, generating plots, etc.), you may need to update the import path based on your local directory structure. This is typically done by modifying the Python `sys.path` using the `os` and `sys` libraries to ensure your scripts can locate and import custom modules.  
>  
> Example:
> ```python
> import os
> import sys
> sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('path/to/your/module'))
> import trend_sen
> ```


Located in `analysis2/`

*This folder contains comprehensive analyses at the three subwatersheds within the Portneuf watershed. The other difference is each variable is further segregated into cultivated (cropland and pasture) and non-cultivated area based on NLCD layer (2005). It includes all relevant datasets, their preprocessing workflows, and detailed analytical scripts for trend detection, statistical summaries, and visualization.*

| `nlcd` | NLCD data merging and initial analysis along with graphics |
| `nlcd_raster` | Map code based on NLCD geotiff |
| `openet` | OpenET data merging and initial analysis along with graphics based on landcover. Also include dataset of each individual model |
| `shp` | Contains shapefile used in all the analysis. `portneuf3_clean` is the final shapefile |
